      <description>1. Intro Namaste, Hello, Hola, I&amp;rsquo;m Tarang Ranpara! 👋
Tarang was born in Rajkot and, against all odds, grew up. After his undergrad, he joined ISRO and worked with some of the brightest minds in India, where he learned that “rocket science” is exactly as hard as it sounds but far less dramatic without background music. Later, he pursued his Master’s at DA-IICT, majoring in Machine Learning while also mastering electives like late-night Maggi and debugging code that only breaks during demos.</description>
