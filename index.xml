      <description>Hi 👋, Namaste 🙏, Hello World 🌎!!
I&amp;rsquo;m Tarang, and I welcome you to my humble abode on the vast internet. Once upon a time, I thought of calling this site “Engineer’s Guide to Life” - a manual of sorts, a tidy map to navigate the chaos of code and existence. But as it turns out, life, much like code, refuses to be neatly organized. Bugs show up where you least expect them, refactors happen overnight, and failures are the norm, not the exception.</description>

      <description>1. Intro Namaste, Hello, Hola, I&amp;rsquo;m Tarang Ranpara! 👋
Tarang was born in Rajkot and, against all odds, grew up. After his undergrad, he joined ISRO and worked with some of the brightest minds in India, where he learned that “rocket science” is exactly as hard as it sounds but far less dramatic without background music. Later, he pursued his Master’s at DA-IICT, majoring in Machine Learning while also mastering electives like late-night Maggi and debugging code that only breaks during demos.</description>
